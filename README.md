# MyRust
a basic cargo project in rust.

it doesn't do too much, but it intrigues the user, and if you want to run it
type `cargo build` and then after it's done compiling,
type `cargo run`
 and you're good to go. Alternatively, you can email me the executable if you don't
 have rust installed at kigangadarell@gmail.com.
 Thank you!
